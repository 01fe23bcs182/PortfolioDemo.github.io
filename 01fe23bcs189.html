        <section>
            <h2>1.How do you determine the most efficient approach when solving a complex problem?</h2>
            <p>"To determine the most efficient approach,i will analyze the problem constraints, break it into smaller parts, and evaluate solutions based on time, space, and resource efficiency. Choose the method that best balances performance and simplicity</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. How do you balance multiple conflicting constraints in a design?</h2>
            <p> I will balance conflicting constraints by prioritizing based on project goals, assessing trade-offs, and finding compromises that optimize critical factors. Iterative testing and stakeholder feedback ensure alignment with requirements</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. What criteria do you use to evaluate the effectiveness of a solution?</h2>
            <p> I check if the solution solves the problem, works well within limits, is easy to use, reliable, and can handle future needs. It should also be cost-effective and easy to maintain </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. How can you adapt an existing solution to address a new or unforeseen challenge?</h2>
            <p> To adapt a solution, analyze the new challenge, identify gaps in the current solution, and make necessary changes. Test the updated solution to ensure it works for the new problem.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. What strategies do you use to identify patterns or structures in datasets or problems?</h2>
            <p> To identify patterns, I analyze data trends, visualize the data, and apply algorithms like clustering or correlation analysis. I also look for recurring elements and use statistical methods to detect relationships.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>6. How do you decide when to prioritize simplicity over optimization in a solution?</h2>
            <p>I prioritize simplicity when the problem scale is small or optimization has diminishing returns. In larger systems, optimization becomes a higher priority.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>7. How does breaking down a problem into smaller components help solve it more effectively?</h2>
            <p>Prioritize simplicity when the solution is easy to understand, maintain, and meets the basic requirements. Opt for optimization only when performance improvements are necessary and the complexity added is justifiable.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>8. What trade-offs do you consider when solving problems?</h2>
            <p>When solving problems, I consider trade-offs between time, cost, performance, and complexity. I evaluate whether improving one factor may negatively impact another, and choose the best balance for the specific situation.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>9. How do you identify and address potential limitations or weaknesses in a proposed solution?</h2>
            <p> To identify limitations, I review the solution for possible risks, edge cases, and constraints. I address weaknesses by testing, seeking feedback, and adjusting the solution to improve robustness and efficiency. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>10. How does applying knowledge from one context help solve a problem in another context?</h2>
            <p> Applying knowledge from one context helps by providing proven strategies, frameworks, or patterns that can be adapted to new situations. This saves time, reduces errors, and offers fresh perspectives for solving problems.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>11. How do you decide when to innovate versus relying on tried-and-tested solutions?</h2>
            <p>Decide to innovate when existing solutions don't meet requirements or efficiency goals. Rely on tried-and-tested solutions when they are proven, cost-effective, and fit the problem well, ensuring reliability and simplicity</p>
