            <h2>1. What are the kinds of problems we see in nature? (Iteration, Recursion, Backtracking)</h2>
            <p>Problems in nature can often be modeled using algorithms that exhibit iterative, recursive, or backtracking approaches. Iteration involves repeating a set of operations until a condition is met, recursion involves solving a problem by breaking it down into smaller sub-problems of the same type, and backtracking is used to find solutions by exploring all possibilities and undoing steps when a condition is violated.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> The Fibonacci sequence can be calculated through both recursion and iteration, but recursion is more natural when modeling divide-and-conquer problems, while iteration is often more efficient.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. What is space and time efficiency? Why are they important? Explain the different class of problems and orders of growth.</h2>
            <p>Space efficiency refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses, and time efficiency refers to the amount of time it takes to complete. These are critical factors in algorithm design, especially when working with large datasets or in resource-constrained environments.</p>
            <p>Algorithms are classified based on their time and space complexities, using Big O notation to express the order of growth. Common classes of problems include linear (O(n)), logarithmic (O(log n)), quadratic (O(n²)), and exponential (O(2^n)) complexities.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Take away from different design principles from chapter 2.</h2>
            <p>Chapter 2 emphasizes important design principles like "divide and conquer," "greedy algorithms," "dynamic programming," and "backtracking." These principles guide the approach to solving complex problems efficiently by breaking them into smaller, more manageable parts or choosing optimal solutions based on local conditions.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. The hierarchical data and how different tree data structures solve and optimize over the problem scenarios.</h2>
            <p>Hierarchical data can be represented and optimized using various tree data structures. Examples include binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, 2-3 trees, red-black trees, heaps, and tries. Each structure has specific advantages, such as AVL trees ensuring balanced height for quicker lookups, or heaps being optimized for fast insertion and deletion in priority queue applications.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. The need of array query algorithms and their implications. Their applications and principles need to be discussed.</h2>
            <p>Array query algorithms are essential for efficiently accessing, updating, and processing elements in large arrays. Efficient algorithms allow us to search, sort, or manipulate data quickly. Applications include range queries in databases, searching for patterns in data, and optimizing data access in caches or memory.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>6. Differentiate between tree and graphs and their traversals. The applications of each.</h2>
            <p>Trees are hierarchical data structures with a root and a set of child nodes, whereas graphs are non-linear structures with nodes connected by edges. Both have various traversal algorithms: trees use methods like pre-order, in-order, and post-order, while graphs can be traversed using depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS). Applications of trees include file system structures, while graphs are used in networking and social networks.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>7. Deliberate on sorting and searching algorithms, the technique behind each and how they connect to the real world.</h2>
            <p>Sorting algorithms like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Bubble Sort each have distinct advantages and disadvantages. Quick Sort is typically faster for large datasets, while Merge Sort is stable and efficient for linked lists. Searching algorithms like Binary Search and Linear Search are fundamental for data retrieval, with Binary Search being much faster for sorted data. These algorithms have applications in databases, search engines, and everyday software like e-commerce platforms.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>1. How do you determine the most efficient approach when solving a complex problem?</h2>
            <p>To determine the most efficient approach, I analyze the problem’s constraints and objectives. By understanding the problem size, input types, and expected output, I can determine which algorithm or data structure fits best. I evaluate the time and space complexity of potential solutions, using Big O notation to choose the most efficient approach.</p>
            <p><strong>Example</strong>: When deciding between different sorting algorithms, I would choose Quick Sort for large datasets due to its average O(n log n) performance, as opposed to Bubble Sort’s O(n²).</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Reflect on a situation where you need to balance multiple conflicting constraints in a design. What approach did you take?</h2>
            <p>In our smart city design project, we had to balance between time efficiency, space efficiency, and real-time processing. I focused on optimizing key algorithms while ensuring that memory usage and response times were within acceptable limits.</p>
            <p><strong>Example</strong>: For the Job Matching System, I had to balance speed and accuracy, opting for an efficient search algorithm like Knuth-Morris-Pratt over simpler methods like brute-force string matching.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. What criteria do you use to evaluate the effectiveness of a solution?</h2>
            <p>I evaluate solutions based on their efficiency (time and space complexity), scalability (how well the solution handles increased input sizes), and correctness (whether it solves the problem within the expected constraints). Additionally, I assess its flexibility and maintainability.</p>
            <p><strong>Example</strong>: For the Unemployment Rate Calculation, the Dijkstra’s and Bellman-Ford algorithms were tested for both speed and accuracy in calculating shortest paths to employment.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. How can you adapt an existing solution to address a new or unforeseen challenge?</h2>
            <p>By analyzing the root cause of the challenge and identifying the components of the existing solution that need modification. If an unforeseen challenge arises, I break down the problem and adjust the algorithm or data structure accordingly, ensuring minimal disruption to the overall system.</p>
            <p><strong>Example</strong>: If a new job sector arises, I would adapt the Job Vacancy Database Management system to include dynamic categorization, ensuring future scalability.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. What strategies do you use to identify patterns or structures in datasets or problems?</h2>
            <p>I use data visualization techniques to identify patterns, then choose appropriate algorithms (e.g., clustering or sorting) to exploit those patterns. I also rely on statistical analysis or machine learning models when necessary to identify structures that aren't immediately obvious.</p>
            <p><strong>Example</strong>: In job distribution optimization, I used geographic data to identify clusters of high unemployment areas and applied graph algorithms like Kruskal’s and Prim’s for optimal job allocation.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>6. How do you decide when to prioritize simplicity over optimization in a solution?</h2>
            <p>I prioritize simplicity when a solution needs to be implemented quickly, is intended for smaller datasets, or if performance differences are negligible for the application. I consider simplicity first for maintainability and when scalability isn’t a primary concern.</p>
            <p><strong>Example</strong>: For the Job Search System, I initially opted for Brute Force String Matching, as the simplicity of implementation was more important for a small-scale, initial version of the system.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>7. Reflect on how breaking down a problem into smaller components can help you approach it more effectively.</h2>
            <p>Breaking a problem into smaller components simplifies implementation and debugging. Techniques like divide-and-conquer leverage this to solve complex problems more efficiently.</p>
            <p><strong>Example</strong>: The smart city project was divided into components like job matching, vacancy management, and economic reporting. This helped in isolating the complex task of job distribution optimization from other aspects of the system.</p>
